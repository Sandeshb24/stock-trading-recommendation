Here's a brief explanation of the theory behind the stock project:

### Theory and Workflow

**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for stock trading using historical stock data and technical indicators. The model aims to generate buy or sell signals based on historical patterns, which can be used to make informed trading decisions.

**Data Collection:**
- **Source:** Historical stock data is fetched using the `yfinance` library.
- **Variables:** The data includes features such as stock prices (`Close`), trading volumes (`Volume`), and dates.

**Feature Engineering:**
- **Technical Indicators:** Various technical indicators are calculated to provide insights into stock price movements:
  - **Simple Moving Average (SMA_20):** A 20-day moving average of the closing price.
  - **Exponential Moving Average (EMA_20):** A 20-day exponential moving average of the closing price.
  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Measures the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
  - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** A momentum oscillator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price.
  - **MACD Signal Line:** A smoothed version of the MACD line used to generate trading signals.
  - **Bollinger Bands:** Consist of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands representing standard deviations from the middle band.
  - **Volume Average:** 20-day average of trading volumes.

**Model Building and Training:**
- **Model Choice:** A Random Forest Classifier is used due to its robustness and ability to handle a large number of features.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV is employed to optimize model parameters for better performance.
- **Training and Evaluation:** The data is split into training and test sets to evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy.

**Prediction and Signal Generation:**
- **Trading Signal:** Based on the model’s predictions, a trading signal (buy or sell) is generated.
- **Recommendation:** The signal is saved to a file for further use and displayed as output.

**Visualization:**
- **Plotting:** The stock price and trading signals are plotted to visually assess the model’s performance and trading recommendations.

**Main Workflow:**
1. Fetch historical stock data.
2. Calculate technical indicators.
3. Build and train the predictive model.
4. Generate trading signals.
5. Save and display the recommendations.
6. Plot the results for visualization.

The project integrates data fetching, feature engineering, model training, and prediction to assist in stock trading decisions.
